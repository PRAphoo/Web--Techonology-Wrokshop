    <p>
        I am glad to introduce myself as Praphool Jung Thakuri, son of Mrs. Laxmi Pandit. 
I am the grandson of Mr. Rudra Jung Jyu Thakuri and Mrs. Bhim Kumari Thakuri, 
a permanent resident of Bidur Municipality Ward No 7, Nuwakot, Nepal. I come 
from a loving and supporting family. My mother raised me and brought me to where 
I am today. I am equally grateful to my grandparents for always being there for me 
in every step of my life. I am 20-year-old individual with a deep interest in computer 
and technology. I am always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge, 
which is why I enjoy traveling and exploring new places whenever I have the 
opportunity. I am very excited to be applying to Bachelor in Information Technology 
(BIT) in Herald college and looking forward to the opportunities it will provide me 
to further develop my skills and achieve my career goals.
